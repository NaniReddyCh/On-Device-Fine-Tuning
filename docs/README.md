# Technical Documentation

This repository presents a research-driven implementation and fine-tuning workflow for the PRGE (Parallelized Randomized Gradient Estimation) model, specifically designed for advanced relation extraction tasks.

Significant effort has been invested to ensure that the methodology, code, and documentation meet research standards, enabling reproducibility and rigorous experimentation for academic and applied research.

## Overview

The project aims to adapt and fine-tune the PRGE model for custom datasets and specific application requirements. The approach follows research-level methodologies as detailed in the attached [PRGE_fine_tuning.pdf](./PRGE_fine_tuning.pdf).

## Contents

- **PRGE_fine_tuning.pdf**  
  Comprehensive technical documentation covering the model architecture, data preparation, fine-tuning procedures, and evaluation metrics.

- **Source Code**  
  Scripts and modules for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

1. **Review the Documentation:**  
   Refer to [PRGE_fine_tuning.pdf](./PRGE_fine_tuning.pdf) for detailed instructions and theoretical background.

2. **Prepare Your Data:**  
   Format your dataset as described in the documentation.

3. **Configure and Run:**
